ReCert: SSI and Prosumer-driven REC
=======================================
Renewable Energy Certificates (REC), a type of Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC), are used to track the production and consumption of renewable energy. ReCert introduces a Re-certification mechanism leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) to standardize EACs. This standardization enables global trading of EACs through a blockchain-based marketplace.
