# For Developed and Developing Countries

The development of a decentralized Blockchain-based Energy Trading (BCTE) solution requires a foundational framework capable of evolving into a fully functional system. This section analyzes the different requirements and efforts needed for implementing BCTE in developed and developing countries, focusing on the ETT project in Europe and the potential benefits for Pakistan.

### Use Case of Developed Countries in Europe
The ETT project, operating in four European nations (Denmark, Germany, Belgium, and Estonia), aims to trace and monitor renewable energy through Granular Certificates (GCs). While GCs are effective, the centralized control by Distribution System Operators (DSOs) is a major limitation. ReCert proposes to decentralize this process using IOTA’s Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and edge computing, allowing aggregation at the prosumer level for improved decentralization.

### Use Case of Developing Country: Pakistan
In Pakistan, limited smart metering infrastructure and high distribution losses hinder BCTE adoption. However, the phased integration of BCTE at the distribution transformer level could reduce these losses and improve grid efficiency. Pakistan’s government is already committed to installing smart devices for real-time data transmission, creating opportunities for blockchain integration at the transformer level.

### Requirements for a Foundational Framework of BCTE
This section outlines the essential requirements for a foundational framework to evolve into a decentralized BCTE solution. While ReCert’s current focus is on a prosumer-driven approach for developed countries, future work could adapt the framework for transformer-driven solutions in developing countries.

#### Key Requirements:
1. **Decentralized Identity (DI)**: The BCTE framework must operate over Decentralized Identity (DI) to ensure decentralization, which can be achieved through Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) (Section 4).
2. **Fine-Grained Certificate Management**: The framework must manage certificates at a fine-grained level and support certificate slicing and merging to match energy production and consumption (Section 4 and Sub-section 6.3).
3. **Government Accountability**: Government agencies must have the ability to relate real identities to their Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for accountability (Sub-section 6.1).
4. **Low Operational Cost**: The registry must handle high throughput with minimal operational costs, achievable using IOTA's feeless transaction model (Sub-section 6.2).
5. **Evolutionary Nature**: The framework should be flexible enough to evolve into a fully operational BCTE solution (Sub-section 6.4).
