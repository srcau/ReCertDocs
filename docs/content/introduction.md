The shift towards renewable energy has led to innovations in how energy is managed. Blockchain-based Energy Trading (BCTE) is emerging as a decentralized solution that improves transparency and automation in energy transactions, enabling peer-to-peer energy trading and boosting renewable energy adoption.

### Challenges and Strategy for BCTE Implementation
BCTE, though promising, faces challenges in implementation. A step-by-step approach, starting with essential features, is required to evolve into a full-scale solution. This study proposes a foundational framework, ReCert, to guide this evolution.

### ReCert Framework and its Core Modules
ReCert focuses on three key BCTE modules: Decentralized Identity (DI), Indexing through Aggregation (IA), and Granular Certificates (GC). These modules leverage Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) to manage identities, aggregate certificates, and issue verifiable Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).

### Granular Certificates and Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs)
RECs issued through blockchain help ensure clean energy sourcing. Granular Certificates (GCs) extend this by operating at minute intervals for smaller energy amounts. ReCert replaces centralized registries with decentralized alternatives to handle high transaction volumes efficiently.

### ReCert's Decentralized Approach
ReCert's decentralized approach uses prosumer meters and IOTA-driven registries to manage the aggregation of certificates. The framework is designed to address the blockchain trilemma by balancing scalability, security, and decentralization.

### Role of SSI and Blockchain Integration in ReCert
SSI plays a crucial role in ReCert by allowing prosumer meters to issue GCs over IOTA’s feeless transaction model. This integration anchors numerous GCs in Merkle trees to the public blockchain, ensuring security and immutability with minimal gas fees.

### Layered Architecture of ReCert
ReCert’s three-layered architecture optimizes blockchain scalability, security, and decentralization. The integration of IOTA’s feeless model with public blockchain security makes ReCert an economically feasible solution for handling high transaction volumes.

### ReCert’s Evolution towards Decentralized BCTE
The ReCert framework is flexible and extendable, potentially transforming into a fully decentralized BCTE solution in the future.
