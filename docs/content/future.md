### Complete Roadmap of ReCert

As a future work, we are implementing a testbed to perform the quantitative analysis of the proposed ReCert solution. The existing versions of the ReCert solution have performed qualitative analysis and discussed the technical and architectural choices made on a theoretical level. Through comprehensive experimental investigations, the pivotal quantitative analysis phase helps refine and enhance the ReCert solution, thereby priming it for pragmatic deployment within real-world scenarios. This progression signifies a stride towards establishing an encompassing blockchain-based energy transaction ecosystem, resonating with the objectives articulated in the IEEE's position paper on BCTE. Hence, our proposed framework signifies a seminal step towards the groundwork for the evolution of a fully functional BCTE solution.

The quantitative analysis will help improve layers 1 and 2 of the ReCert framework. For the improvements in layer 3, we suggest the addition of new modules that can transform ReCert into a decentralized BCTE framework. For example, adding a marketplace module in the third layer of the ReCert framework and transforming SSI-based ReCert certificates into an interoperability standard can enable the global trading of green energy certificates that are currently tradable only within geographical boundaries.
