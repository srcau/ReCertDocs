#### Role of ReCert as a foundational framework for BCTE
This section explains the reasons behind selecting Concordium, IOTA, and SSI technologies for the ReCert framework, emphasizing their roles in creating a fully functional BCTE solution.

### Importance of Concordium Blockchain as a Single Source of Truth
Concordium is chosen for its decentralized identity support and accountability features. It serves as the backbone of the ReCert framework, ensuring reliability and fast transaction finalization even under adversarial conditions, as shown in Figure 6.

### Role of IOTA in Handling a Large Number of Prosumer-meter Transactions
IOTA’s feeless transaction model is ideal for managing the high volume of prosumer-meter-generated transactions. It serves as a short-term backup for the ReCert framework, reducing operational costs by removing duplicate certificates after anchoring them in Concordium.

### Importance of SSI to Support Granular ReCert Certificates
SSI’s ability to split and merge certificates makes it essential for managing fine-grained ReCert certificates. This capability aligns with prosumer meter operations, making it a better fit than NFTs or SFTs for granular certificate management.

### Potential to Evolve ReCert into a Fully Operational BCTE Solution
Figure 7 outlines the hierarchical architecture of the ReCert framework, highlighting the layered approach. Layer 1 ensures blockchain-based truth, Layer 2 scales transactions using DLT, and Layer 3 supports the addition of future BCTE modules, allowing the system to evolve as needs grow.
