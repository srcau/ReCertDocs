# ReCert: SSI and Prosumer-driven REC

Renewable Energy Certificates (REC), a type of Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC), are used to track the production and consumption of renewable energy. ReCert introduces a Re-certification mechanism leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) to standardize EACs. This standardization enables global trading of EACs through a blockchain-based marketplace. 

## Introduction

The introduction section explains an overview of our current version of the ReCert.

## Need and Significance of ReCert

This section presents the significance of ReCert and highlights the requirements for the foundational framework (like ReCert) of a decentralized BCTE solution.

## Role of SSI in ReCert

This section explains the Self-sovereign Identity and its pivotal role in the realization of ReCert.

##  Blockchain Trilemma Challenges 

This section delves into the concept of blockchain technology and introduces the challenges of solving the blockchain trilemma. This section also justifies the addition of an extra DLT layer to manage the high volume of transactions associated with granular ReCert certificates.

## Archicteture of ReCert

This section presents the architecture of ReCert, encompassing GCs, DLT, blockchain, and VCs/VPs of SSI, all working in collaboration to support the claimed features of our proposed solution of the ReCert framework.

## ReCert as a Foundation Framework for BCTE

This section justifies the technologies adopted in our proposed solution of ReCert. It also shows the feasibility of our proposed solution as the foundational framework that can transform it into a fully decentralized BCTE solution.

## Under-development Features

This section defines the future roadmap of ReCert and what is the current progress on the stated features of ReCert.
