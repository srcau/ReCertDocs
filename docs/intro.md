# ReCert - A Prosumer-centric BCTE Solution

Blockchain-enabled Transactive Energy (BCTE) heralds a revolutionary departure from traditional paradigms to achieve decentralization and its benefits in the energy sector. Despite the foundational insights provided by the IEEE's seminal position paper in 2021, the practical realization of BCTE still needs to be achieved, necessitating substantial research and development endeavors toward the real-world realization of BCTE. Our study responds to this imperative by presenting a foundational framework of ReCert that aims to unlock the full potential of BCTE through a prosumer-centric approach and sets a cornerstone to advance toward a fully functional BCTE solution.

ReCert introduces a Re-Certification mechanism that operates over Self-sovereign Identity (SSI), which also serves as a gluing force between the DLT and blockchain components of the ReCert framework to tackle the challenges of the blockchain trilemma. This study shows the feasibility of the ReCert framework in supporting the BCTE modules of Granular Certificates (GC), Decentralized Identity (DI), and Aggregation that operate through the concepts of SSI. The evolutionary framework of ReCert follows the layered approach to establish the groundwork for transforming into a fully decentralized BCTE solution. 

## Why run Jupyter Book with Read the Docs?

[Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) simplifies developing Jupyter Book projects by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your project for you.
You might be familiar with Read the Docs for software documentation projects, but these features are just as relevant for science.

With Read the Docs, you can improve collaboration on your Jupyter Book project with Git (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket etc.) and then connect the Git repository to Read the Docs.
Once Read the Docs and the git repository are connected, your project will be built and published automatically every time you commit and push changes with git.
Furthermore, if you open Pull Requests, you can preview the result as rendered by Jupyter Book.

## What is in this example?

Jupyter Book has a number of built-in features.
This is a small example book to give you a feel for how book content is structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation][jb-docs] for more information.

* [Examples of Markdown](/markdown)
* [Rendering a notebook Jupyter Notebook](/notebooks)
* [A notebook written in MyST Markdown](/markdown-notebooks)

We have also added some popular features for Jupyter Book that really you shouldn't miss when building your own project with Jupyter Book and Read the Docs:

* [intersphinx to link to other documentation and Jupyter Book projects](/intersphinx)
* [sphinx-examples to show examples and results side-by-side](/sphinx-examples)
* [sphinx-hoverxref to preview cross-references](/sphinx-hoverxref)
* [sphinx-proof for logic and math, to write proofs, theorems, lemmas etc.](/sphinx-proof)
