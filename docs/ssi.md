### SSI for Decentralized Identity and Certificate Management
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a powerful tool for decentralized identity management, offering advanced features like Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs). It allows for flexible certificate management, making it ideal for BCTE solutions, as shown in our previously published work. The integration of SSI enables decentralized self-certification of prosumer meters in ReCert.

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Root of Trust (RoT)
PKI provides a secure framework for digital communications through digital certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs). However, its centralized nature poses a risk since the compromise of a Root CA can undermine the entire trust chain. This centralized trust model contrasts with the decentralized principles needed for BCTE, where decentralized trust models like SSI offer more resilient alternatives.

### Centralized Trust in ETT
The ETT project uses centralized registries to manage energy certificates, eliminating blockchain transaction fees but introducing potential security risks. This reliance on centralization could undermine trust in energy certification systems, highlighting the need for decentralized solutions like SSI.

### Effectiveness of SSI in Decentralized Identity
SSI empowers individuals to manage their digital identities without centralized control. Through blockchain, VCs and VPs can be issued and verified autonomously, enhancing privacy and security. The prosumer meters in our proposed ReCert solution use SSI to self-certify energy data and manage their credentials with flexibility and security.

### Algorithmic Trust in SSI
Algorithmic trust in SSI uses cryptographic technologies like digital signatures to establish trust, independent of institutional oversight. This shift away from traditional trust models ensures that credentials remain secure and verifiable through mathematics, providing a transparent and decentralized approach to identity management.

### Autonomic Trust in SSI
Autonomic trust allows individuals to manage their own identities and credentials autonomously in SSI systems. This self-certification process enhances peer-to-peer trust and security in decentralized networks, such as prosumer energy systems, where prosumer meters generate and verify energy certificates without relying on centralized authorities.

### SSI Support in IOTA and Concordium
Concordium supports SSI at the blockchain level, but using it for storing green energy certificates may not be cost-effective. Instead, we propose utilizing IOTA Tangle, which now supports SSI and smart contracts, for a more efficient decentralized solution in ReCert.
